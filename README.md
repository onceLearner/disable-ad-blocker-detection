# Disable ad-blocker Detection âœ…
## Motivation
 Lately, I got annoyed with website asking to disable ad-blocker to continue navigation ðŸ¤¬, so I decided to build this sample chrome extention that disable such annoying exeperience.
## How to use it
 Simply:
 - clone this git repo.
 `git clone <current-repo>`;
 - On Chrome ðŸ§­, go to  `extensions` >  `Manage extensions`
 - In the top right corner (might change in the future ðŸ«£), click on `Load unpacked` and just load the current working directory.

 - PAAM ! Happy navigation ðŸ˜Ž

## What's next
On my spare time, I might expand it to more website,âœ…
- ps: don't hesitate asking to add your website. Just open an issue if you are non-techy
